# Autonomous Intelligence System (AIS) — Enterprise Blueprint

## Overview

AIS is an enterprise-grade, autonomous intelligence platform inspired by POI’s "The Machine". It integrates multi-source data ingestion, advanced AI analysis, reasoning, and ethical decision-making in a scalable microservices architecture.

## Repository Structure

- `/docs` — Detailed technical documentation and diagrams  
- `/services` — Microservice code skeletons with FastAPI and Dockerfiles  
- `/deployment` — Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and CI/CD pipelines  
- `/ai_models` — AI integration stubs for NLP, Vision, Audio, and Fusion  
- `/prototype` — Local single-machine prototype setup  
- `/compliance` — Security and governance policy templates  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Kubernetes cluster (minikube / kind for local testing)  
- Python 3.10+  
- Helm CLI (for production deployment)  

### Running Local Prototype

```bash
cd prototype
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker-compose up
```

### Deploying Microservices on Kubernetes

```bash
cd deployment/k8s
kubectl apply -f ingestion.yaml
kubectl apply -f nlp.yaml
# ... apply other services similarly
```
