## Overview

AIS is an enterprise-grade, autonomous intelligence platform inspired by POI’s "The Machine". It integrates multi-source data ingestion, advanced AI analysis, reasoning, and ethical decision-making in a scalable microservices architecture.

## Repository Structure

- `/docs` — Detailed technical documentation and diagrams  
- `/services` — Microservice code skeletons with FastAPI and Dockerfiles  
- `/deployment` — Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and CI/CD pipelines  
- `/ai_models` — AI integration stubs for NLP, Vision, Audio, and Fusion  
- `/prototype` — Local single-machine prototype setup  
- `/compliance` — Security and governance policy templates  

## Getting Started
